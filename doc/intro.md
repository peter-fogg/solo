# solo

Solo is a monadic parser combinator library, largely inspired by
[Parsec](http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html). While not (yet?) as
fully-featured, solo implements a good portion of Parsec's
functionality, and what's missing can be readily added.

If you're actually interested in using solo, check out
`examples/json.clj` to see what's possible.
